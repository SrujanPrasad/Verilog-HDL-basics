# Verilog HDL
This repository contains all the verilog codes of combinational and seqeuntial circuits along with some applications.


## 1. Basic Gates 

The basic gates are : 
```mermaid
graph TD;
Gates-->NOT;
Gates-->AND;
Gates-->OR;
Gates-->NAND;
Gates-->NOR;
Gates-->XOR;
Gates-->XNOR;
```

- y[0] represents the NOT operation of a
- y[1] represents the AND operation of a and b
- y[2] represents the OR operation of a and b
- y[3] represents the NAND operation of a and b
- y[4] represents the NOR operation of a and b
- y[5] represents the XOR operation of a and b
- y[6] represents the XNOR operation of a and b

## 2. Combinational Circuits 
```mermaid
graph TD;
comb-->HalfAdder;
comb-->FullAdder;
comb-->Multiplexer;
comb-->Demultiplexer;
comb-->Encoder;
comb-->Decoder;
comb-->PriorityEncoder;
```
